# NYC-Citibike

Overall Objective
Utilizing the data bike rental program in NYC, we need to determine if such an endeavour should be implimented in Des Moines, IA. By creating various visulaizations within Tableau we can help pin point exact areas of interest and concern that will potentially influence the deision making process. Getting the data into a more concise and usable format was the first task that needed to be accomplished utilizing Python Pandas. Once done, the visulaizations that were created utilzing this cleaner form of data were put into a story format by which to help guide the user in understanding their impact.

Manhattan constitues the bulk of the rental activity within the geographic area.

Summary
OVerall this business model seems to do well within one of the largest cities in the U.S. based on the participation. However, NYC is a city where most people do not drive vehicles to get from point A to point B. Therefore they need bike's to help the population move around. I have a feeling that given Des Moines' size and population it would be duplicate to duplicate these results on an overall population percentage perspective. I suppose we could look at income in addition to gender to help pin point the kind of folks utilizing these services. In addition, visulaizing the costs for these rides would help as well.
